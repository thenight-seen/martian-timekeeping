# Martian timekeeping - v. 0.1.0 - 19.09.2025

## What is it all about?

Intedned as a small app/script to calculate and show date and time on Mars. 
**Where?** I think medidian 0° or 15°E.
**What time?** At the moment using "normal"/Earth units (h;m;s), not proportionally longer Martian ones, so there are ~ 40 leap minutes at the end of each day. I want to add the other variant too.
**Showing how?** It prints to terminal: local (Earth) date and time, Martian date (day, name of month, year, day of week and number of week), Martian time (hours, minutes, seconds).
**What are those months?** There are two sets of names, letters of Greek alphabet and letters of runic (FUThARK) alphabet. Both are chosen by me because I like them and both were sets of 24 names.

## To Do List

1. Add colours for readability, because I like ANSI escape codes :3
2. Add calculation of proportional time units so Martian day (sol) would have 24 (Martian) hours
3. Add chooice location/meridian on Mars to adjust local (Martian) time displayed
4. Add choice of set of names for months
5. Add choice of input of date/time (from variables, not only present local time)
6. Add choice of output (neat variables, not only terminal)
